# EC200

In this project, we are going to see how to interface GSM Module(EC200) to USB to TTL(CP2102). So lets get to business!

A GSM(Global System for Mobile Communication) module is used to enable communication between microcontroller or microprocessor and GSM network.<br><br>
It is highly recommended to go through the [Datasheet](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip) and [AT Command Manual](https://www.quectel.com/ProductDownload/EC200T.zip) before proceeding further. You can also checkout the [Quectel Website](https://www.quectel.com/) for more details regarding their products.<br><br>
Okay! Now letâ€™s see how to connect a GSM module to USB to TTL(CP2102)!
