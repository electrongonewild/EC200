# EC200

In this project, we are going to see how to interface GSM Module(EC200) to USB to TTL(CP2102). So lets get to business!

A GSM(Global System for Mobile Communication) module is used to enable communication between microcontroller or microprocessor and GSM network.
It is highly recommended to go through the Datasheet and AT Command Manual.<br>
Okay! Now letâ€™s see how to connect a GSM module to USB to TTL(CP2102)!
